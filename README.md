# Introduction to Higher Order Functions

A basic programming concept is D.R.Y.: Don't Repeat Yourself. using functions is a good example for staying DRY.

# Exercises

## Basic Requirments

0. its good to know that we have, Two Forms of Functions

```js
// function declaration 
 function square(x) { 
       return x * x; 
 } 
 // function expression 
 var square = function(x) { 
       return x * x; 
 }; 
 
```

1. We have two ways of writing a function. The function declaration is what we've used so far, and the function expression is new to us. Rewrite the following function declarations using a function expression:

```js
// 1. 
 function cube(x) { 
       return x * x * x; 
 } 
 // 2. 
 function fullname(first, last) { 
       return first + ' ' + last; 
 } 
 // 3. 
 function power(base, exp) { 
       if (exp === 0) { 
       return 1; 
       } 
       return base * power(base, exp - 1); 
 } 
 // 4. 
 function sumCubes(numbers) { 
       var total = 0; 
       for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) { 
             total = total + cube(numbers[i]); 
       } 
       return total; 
 }
```

2. Write each as seen below in your main.js file.

```js
 function each(array, func) { 
       for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { 
             func(array[i]); 
       } 
 }
```

3. Finish the implementation of sumSquares below (using each):

```js
 function sumSquares(numbers) { 
       var total = 0; 
       // ... 
       return total; 
 }
```

4. Rewrite sumCubes using each:

```js
 function sumCubes(numbers) { 
       var total = 0; 
       for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) { 
             total = total + cube(numbers[i]); 
       } 
       return total; 
 }
```

5. Write a function called product that calculates the product of an array of numbers using a for loop; then, refactor it to use each

6. Write a function called cubeAll that cubes each number in an array, and returns an array of all the numbers cubed using a for loop; then, refactor it to use each.

7. Write a function called odds that accepts an array as a parameter and returns an array of just the odd numbers. If you wrote it using each, great! If you used anything else, refactor it to use a for loop.

## More Practice

1. Write a function sumByAllElementsMultipliedByFour that takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of all elements multiplied by four.

2. Observe that sumByAllElementsMultipliedByFour is a terrible name for a function â€“ you should also notice that sumByAllElementsMultipliedByFour looks a lot like sumCubes and sumSquares. Write a function sumBy that accepts two arguments: an array of numbers and a function. The function will be invoked upon each element in the array, and its result will be used to compute the sum.

```js
function sumBy(numbers, f) { 
       // ... 
 } 
 var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; 
 sumBy(numbers, square); // => 30 
 sumBy(numbers, cube); // => 100 
 sumBy(numbers, function(number) { 
       return number * 4; 
 }); 
 // => 40
```

3. How can you use each to compute the sum of an array of numbers (just the plain sum)?

4. Write a function productBy that works like sumBy, but for products.

5. As an extended exercise, run back through your data modeling code from the past few days and look for opportunities to refactor your use of for loops using each.

## Advanced

1. Write a function doubleAll that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns an array of all of those numbers doubled:

```js
function doubleAll(numbers) { 
       // ... 
 } 
 doubleAll([1, 3, 10, 4, 7]); // => [2, 6, 20, 8, 14]
```

2. Write a function halveAll that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns an array of all of those numbers halved (divided by two).

3. Write a function uppercaseAll that takes an array of strings as a parameter, and returns an array of all of those strings, but transformed to upper case. You can use toUpperCase to convert a string to upper case.

```js
'hello, world'.toUpperCase(); // => 'HELLO, WORLD'
```

4. You should at this point notice a similarity between all of the above functions, as well as the cubeAll function from the warmup. These functions all define what we call mappings; that is, they map from one value to another.

```js
 // doubleAll maps from an array of numbers to an array of doubled numbers 
 // [1, 2, 3, 4] => [2, 4, 6, 8] 
 // halveAll maps from an array of numbers to an array of halved numbers 
 // [1, 2, 3, 4] => [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]
```

5. Write a function map that takes two parameters: an array and a function that, when applied to a single element, produces a new element. map should return an array of all elements in the input array transformed using the input function. Your function should work like this:

```js
 function map(array, f) { 
       // ... 
 } 
 map([1, 2, 3, 4], function(x) { 
       return x * 2; 
 }); 
 // => [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

6. Complete the invocations of map below to produce the desired output (you'll need to replace ??? with a function):

```js
 map(['hello', 'world'], ???); // => ['HELLO', 'WORLD'] 
 map(['HelLo', 'WorLD'], ???); // => ['hello', 'world'] 
 map(['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumped'], ???); // => [3, 5, 5, 3, 6] 
 var people = [ 
       {name: {first: 'Grace', middle: 'B.', last: 'Hopper'}, age: 85}, 
       {name: {first: 'Adele', last: 'Goldstine'}, age: 43}, 
       {name: {first: 'Ada', last: 'Lovelace'}, age: 36}, 
       {name: {first: 'Hedy', middle: 'E.', last: 'Lamarr'}, age: 85}, 
       {name: {first: 'Ruchi', last: 'Sanghvi'}, age: 34} 
 ]; 
 map(people, ???); // => ['Grace B. Hopper', 'Adele Goldstine', 'Ada Lovelace', 'Hedy E. Lamarr', 'Ruchi Sanghvi'] 
 map(people, ???); // => ['Grace B. Hopper is 85', 'Adele Goldstine is 43', 'Ada Lovelace is 36', 'Hedy E. Lamarr is 85', 'Ruchi Sanghvi is 34']
```

7. Write a function called evens that takes an array of numbers as a parameter, and returns an array of only the even numbers in the parameter.

8. Write a function called multiplesOfThree that takes an array of numbers as a parameter, and returns an array of only the numbers that are multiples of three.

9. Write a function called positives that takes an array of numbers as a parameter, and returns an array of only the numbers that are positive.

10. Write a function called evenLength that takes an array of strings and returns an array of only the strings with an even length

11. At this point, you should notice a pattern; write a function called filter that takes two parameters: an array and a function that, when invoked with an argument, will return true or false. filter should return a new array of only the elements for which the function returns true:

```js
function filter(array, f) { 
       // ... 
 } 
 filter([1, 2, 3, 4], function(x) { 
       return x % 2 === 0; // x is even? 
 }); // => [2, 4]
```

12. Use filter to write/rewrite:

```js
 odds 
 positives 
 negatives 
 evenLength 
 largerThanSix (given an array of numbers, returns those larger than 6)
```
